title: What's Git Flow?
---

Git Flow is a workflow that uses multiple long-lived branches. As opposed to GitHub Flow, which uses a master or deployed branch with feature branches as the primary way to introduce changes, the Git Flow uses a development branch that new features are created from. The feature branches are merged into the development branch, and the development branch is merged into master.
